# odin-landing-page
In this project I will build a landing page with the provided layout

I have to use tools that I have learnt to style my landing page

The powerful I will use in this project is flexbox which allows me to position sections and parts in my page.

I have used some gifs about black cat
I download them for free on https://pixabay.com/ and the author is MissKaLem(https://pixabay.com/users/misskalem-39644033/).
